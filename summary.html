From 21-23 Dec, 2017, I tried to step out from my comfort zone - joining a 3-day 2-night
camping trip to Sai Kung organized by RedBird.
First, I realize the team cooperation is important. No matter who is the leader, actually we
can everyone be the leader- to leading others and to corporate. In the camp, our group did
corporate each others. In the outdoor challenge, we have a long jogging camp, all of us are tired
but our team cooperation make me work through it. On the sliding slopes, someone almost fall
down to the water and maybe get hurt, luckily we clasped each others hands tightly in case
someone fall down and injured. These scenarios reflected that we did a great job in the team
cooperation.Although this seems trivial, but it’s our big step and we integrated us as a team - not
individuals. I think this will be great for the coming training sessions, to develop more friendships
and cooperation in the working environments in the future.
Second, we learn from failure and are not afraid of failure. The first cooking is like chaos to
some extent, everyone is confused about what they’re going to do, maybe we all rely on someone
to give us decision. Our time management is not optimal, however, we have learned it and
changed it, we did a great job after these chaos. After self-reflection and team discussion, we
outcome an optimal solution, clearly separate and everyone is responsible for its jobs- everyone
have a clear mindset that what they need to do.I’ve learnt it that if we want to do a team work- first,
u need to notice everyone in the team detail of the plan and reach a consensus. In my point of
view, this trivial skills maybe the key point of success as many people don't notice this and assume
everyone are capable to follow up the latest plan/
The prospectus camp is excellent and I enjoyed most parts of this camping experience,
among these valuable experience, I do seize the experience in the camp and learn new stuffs from
others. To admire others enable self-development. I’m glad that I change a lot and also acquire
somehow useful camping skills. In my furture, some of the skills may not be useful , but this doesn't mean they are trivial as it composited every part of my personality and the way and perspective when I counted sth.</p>
